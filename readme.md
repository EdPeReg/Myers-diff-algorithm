The main idea is to implement the Myers diff algorithm using python, we want to get the differences between two text files _f1.txt_ and _f2.txt_. <br>

The goal is to get a similiar output about how Github, _diff_ command line tool or Python module _difflib_ shows the differences. <br>

The files _test.py_ and _diff.py_ are not developed by me and are used just as reference to understand the algorithm.<br>

# How to Run

Python 3.x is needed <br>

```python3 main.py```
